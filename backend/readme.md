# Backend server

The server provides a REST API for storing and fetching contacts.

You may modify the server code to extend the functionality, but if you do, please state what changes you have made under **[Your own changes](#your-own-changes)**.

**Note:** Contacts are stored in-memory and are therefore reset when the server is restarted.
